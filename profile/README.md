# Green Aero Propulsion
Revolutionizing Propulsion For A Sustainable Future

## What We Do
We are a deep-tech company developing the future of Gas Turbine Technology: Clean Propulsion

Our fuel agnostic engines are suited for both civilian and defence applications; we are:
- Deep-tech R&D startup - Incubated at IIT Delhi
- Built from scratch - Design, simulation, machining
- First engine fired - With precision test rigs
- High-speed applications - Drones, UAVs, Aircraft
- Sustainability-first - Reducing emissions through hydrogen-based propulsion

## Our Vision
Green Aero is committed to building a sustainable future. 

Our mission is to decarbonize aviation and shipping through hydrogen-powered, high-efficiency propulsion systems built entirely in-house.​ 

Our technologies are the need of the hour for modern defense requirements. Our focus areas include:
- High speed drones
- Target drones
- Cruise Missiles

## Milestone 1: Combustion Test Rig Development

Successfully ignited hydrogen in a custom-built combustion test rig. This milestone validated our in-house injector design and combustion chamber geometry, laying the groundwork for engine-scale integration.

## Milestone 2: Full Engine Test

Completed our first full-scale engine test in a controlled test cell environment. This marked the integration of all major subsystems — combustion, turbomachinery, and controls — and a major step toward scalable, sustainable propulsion.

## Propelled by
We are proud to be incubated and associated with FITT at IIT Delhi, which is one of the leading universities.
